# VisualSFM

VisualSFM, http://ccwu.me/vsfm/, is a pain to get working "out of the box". This repository will make it slightly easier for you.

* Source code changes location so now and then, henceforth it is put into folders in this repository.
* In `scripts` there is a bash script `dependencies.sh` which can be used to get all required dependencies from the Ubuntu repositories.
